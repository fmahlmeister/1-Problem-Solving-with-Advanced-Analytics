### Part 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/creating-an-analytical-dataset--ud977)
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

- Project: [Data Cleanup](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/2-Creating-an-Analytical-Dataset/2.1-Data-Cleanup.ipynb)
- Project: [Create Report from Database (SQL)](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/2-Creating-an-Analytical-Dataset/2.2-Create-Report-from-Database.ipynb)

### Part 3: [Data Visualization in Tableau](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-in-tableau--ud1006)
Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed.

- Project: [Visualizing Movie Data](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/3-Data-Visualization-in-Tableau/3.1-Visualize-Movie-Data.ipynb)

### Part 4: [Classification Models by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/classification-models--ud978)
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

- Project: [Predicting Default Risk](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/4-Classification-Models/4.1-Predicting-Default-Risk.ipynb)

### Part 5: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979)
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

- Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/5-AB-Testing/5.1-AB-Test-a-New-Menu-Launch.ipynb)

### Part 6: [Time Series Forecasting](https://www.udacity.com/course/time-series-forecasting--ud980)
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

- Project: [Forecast Video Game Sales](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/6-Time-Series-Forecasting/6.1-Forecast-Video-Game-Sales.ipynb)

### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.

- Project: [Predictive Analytics Capstone](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/7-Segmentation-and-Clustering/7.1-Combining-Predictive-Techniques.ipynb)
